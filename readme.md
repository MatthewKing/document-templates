# Document Templates

This repository contains some template documents that I use when consulting or freelancing.

They are designed as simple, single-file HTML documents.

The following templates are present:

* [Tax Invoice](templates/tax-invoice.html) for Australian standard tax invoices.
* [Expense Reimbursement Form](templates/expense-reimbursement.html) for reimbursement of expenses incurred during a job.
